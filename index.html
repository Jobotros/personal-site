          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>My name is Joseph Botros, I live in Winnipeg, Canada. I started loving the webdesign back in early 2000 while I was studying business administration at the univerity. I was so facitnated by the idea of creating someting out of nothing, and how these codes when put toghether can translate what you have in mind to make it a live on the screen. It also matches my characher as I do see my self as a creative person, who likes to explore doing things in new ways..</p>

            <h3>Problem Solving Skills </h3>
            <p>Problem solving skills comes to me naturally, when I was a kid i used to ask someone to knot a rope as much and as hard as they woulc like. Then I would sit down on my own trying to untangle the knots. I would stay patiently as long as an hour trying to do this. This is why I see myself as somewhoe whas has a great deal of patience, try to solve and simplify greater tasks or problems. .</p>
